formula

Using the minimum latency for the application type as an ideal baseline for efficiency is a valid approach. This method considers the minimum latency observed as the optimal performance level, and any deviation from this baseline can be used to compute a measure of efficiency. Here's how you can build a formula based on this approach:

Formula Based on Minimum Latency
Define Ideal Latency:

The minimum latency (Latency_min) for each application type is considered the ideal or baseline latency.
Efficiency Formula:

Efficiency can be calculated as follows:
python
Copy code
df['Efficiency'] = 100 - (df['Latency'] / df['Latency_min']) * 100 + (df['Allocated_Bandwidth'] / df['Allocated_Bandwidth_max']) * 100
Breakdown of the Formula
Latency Component:

df['Latency'] / df['Latency_min']: Normalizes the latency based on the ideal (minimum) latency. If the current latency is equal to the minimum latency, the value will be 1 (100% efficiency for latency).
(df['Latency'] / df['Latency_min']) * 100: Converts this fraction into a percentage. Higher values indicate worse performance relative to the ideal latency.
100 - (df['Latency'] / df['Latency_min']) * 100: Inversely scales latency. As latency increases compared to the ideal, this term decreases.
Allocated Bandwidth Component:

df['Allocated_Bandwidth'] / df['Allocated_Bandwidth_max']: Normalizes allocated bandwidth based on the maximum observed bandwidth.
(df['Allocated_Bandwidth'] / df['Allocated_Bandwidth_max']) * 100: Converts this fraction into a percentage. Higher allocated bandwidth increases this term, reflecting better performance.
Combining Components:

Latency Term: Reflects how close the current latency is to the ideal minimum. Higher latencies reduce this component, indicating worse performance.
Bandwidth Term: Reflects how well the allocated bandwidth is utilized compared to the maximum. Higher bandwidth increases this component.
Example
Suppose we have the following data for an application type:

Ideal Minimum Latency (Latency_min): 30 ms
Maximum Allocated Bandwidth (Allocated_Bandwidth_max): 50 MBps
For different scenarios:

Scenario A:

Latency: 40 ms
Allocated Bandwidth: 20 MBps
Calculation:

Latency Contribution: 100 - (40 / 30) * 100 = 100 - 133.33 = -33.33 (Negative value indicates worse performance compared to the ideal)
Bandwidth Contribution: (20 / 50) * 100 = 40
Efficiency: -33.33 + 40 = 6.67
Scenario B:

Latency: 25 ms
Allocated Bandwidth: 30 MBps
Calculation:

Latency Contribution: 100 - (25 / 30) * 100 = 100 - 83.33 = 16.67
Bandwidth Contribution: (30 / 50) * 100 = 60
Efficiency: 16.67 + 60 = 76.67
